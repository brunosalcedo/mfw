A motherfucking template for job market sites

The contents of the template are based on [EJMR](http://econjobrumors.com/ "Econ Job Rumors")'s favorite fictional character [BB La Croix](https://sites.google.com/site/lacroixbb/ "BB's personal site").

This is a single file template inspired by  [Will Phan](http://www.econ.rochester.edu/wphan/ "Will Phan's website")'s job market site and Barry Smith's [a motherfucking website](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ "A motherfcuking website").

To personalize the template simply open in any text editor and replace BB's information with your own.
